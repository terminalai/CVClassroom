## TO ADD IN DATA 

1. download the zip file of the dataset here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset?resource=download] 
This is what the folder should look like after you extract: 
![Image of folder of extracted dataset from kaggle](<images/image_of_extracted_dataset_from_kaggle.jpg>)

2. Move the files into the stanford cars folder, as seen below: 
!["folder named stanford_cars_dataset"](<images/dataset_folder_name.jpg>)


In the end, this is what the folder should look like: 
![Image of folder after dataset extraction. It contains two sub-folders called "cars_test" and "cars_train", two .csv files called "test.csv" and "train.csv", and a .mat file called "cars_annos.mat"](<images/final_folder_image.png>) 
Note that cars_annos.mat is unnecessary and can be removed.
