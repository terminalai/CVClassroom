## TO ADD IN DATA 
1. create a folder with the name "stanford_cars_dataset" as seen below: 
!["folder named stanford_cars_dataset"](<dataset_folder_name.jpg>)

2. download the zip file of the dataset here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset?resource=download] 
This is what the folder should look like after you extract: 
![Image of folder of extracted dataset from kaggle](<image_of_extracted_dataset_from_kaggle.jpg>)

3. Download both files in this repository: [https://github.com/BotechEngineering/StanfordCarsDatasetCSV/tree/main] Then, rename them to test.csv and train.csv. 

4. Move them into the stanford cars folder. 

In the end, this is what the folder should look like: 
![Image of folder after dataset extraction. It contains two sub-folders called "cars_test" and "cars_train", two .csv files called "test.csv" and "train.csv", and a .mat file called "cars_annos.mat"](<final_folder_image.jpg>) 
Note that cars_annos.mat is unnecessary and can be removed.
